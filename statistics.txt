The time it takes for a Jetphox run depends on many factors like pt, scale choice, even PDF choice...
But here are some rough numbers to plan with:

There is a baseline that always has to be calculated before events are calculated:
-- dir LO ~1min
-- frag LO ~12min
-- dir NLO ~50min
-- frag NLO ~6h

On top comes the calculation time per event:
-- dir  LO  takes 1h per 100M events
-- frag LO  takes 6h per 100M events 
-- dir  NLO takes 3 1/2h per 100M events
-- frag NLO takes 18-30h per 100M events
